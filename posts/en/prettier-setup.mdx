## What is Prettier?

Prettier is a tool for formatting the code in your application. Using prettier will help you write and maintain consistent and easily readable code, which will help team-based application development. But that doesn't mean you don't need prettier in your pet project if you're new to programming or just learning JavaScript - Prettier will help you get into the habit of using best practices for formatting your code. Prettier is supported by most popular IDEs (Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, etc.).

## How to install Prettier in your React app?

First, install the npm package into your project:

For npm:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
```

For yarn:

```
yarn add --dev --exact prettier
```

After installation, add the file **.prettierrc** to the root folder of the project. This file contains the configuration of code formatting rules. The prettier developers recommend the following default configuration:

```JSON
{
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 4,
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

Add this JSON to the generated .prettierrc file.

To automatically fix all existing problems in your project - run the following command in the root of the project:
```
npx prettier --write .
```
For yarn:
```
yarn prettier --write .
```

## Configuring Prettier for ESLint

[Here](eslint-setup) you can find how to install and configure ESLint for your project.

If your project uses ESLint, additional settings will be required.

To get started, you need to install the eslint-config-prettier package in the project. This package will disable all ESLint rules that duplicate or conflict with Prettier:
npm:
```
npm install eslint-config-prettier
```
yarn
```
yarn install eslint-config-prettier
```

Once installed, go to the .eslintrc file and add "prettier" to the list:
```
...
  "extends": [
    "some-other-config-you-use",
    "prettier"
  ]
...
```

## IDE configuration

### Visual Studio Code

Install "Prettier - Code formatter" package to the VS Code.

<Image
    src={`/images/prettier-setup/VS_Prettier.png`}
    width={676}
    height={139}
    priority
/>

After restarting, the IDE will automatically find your .prettierrc file and start highlighting the syntax.

### WebStorm

Go to Settings > Plugins. Search for the Prettier plugin and install it.

<Image
    alt={`Bridge`}
    src={`/images/prettier-setup/WebStorm_Prettier.png`}
    width={327}
    height={54}
    priority
/>

Immediately after installation, a code highlight should appear.

### For other IDE

For other IDEs, you can refer to the [official Prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html). It contains instructions for most popular development environments.
