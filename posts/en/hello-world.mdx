Hello, my name is Habaznia Dmytro.

I am a full-stack (.NET + React.JS) developer with almost three years of commercial experience. During this time, I managed to work with a large number of different languages and technologies, change the stack, and be in the position of the leader of a small project. I hope to share this experience in this blog.

First of all, this blog was created by me as a diary, with the aim of learning how to express thoughts, explain various technical problems and their solutions. As this blog grows, I will also be involved in its development and expansion, which I will also write about here.

The beginning is set.
Thank you for attention.
